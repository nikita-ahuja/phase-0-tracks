RELEASE 3: RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN

-Inner Join: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns.

SELECT title FROM songs INNER JOIN albums on songs.title = albums.name;

Returns nothing in our case since there are no matches in the columns. In my database's case, however, it could show if there is a title track for the album since the song title would match the album name.

* I tested this by adding the "Everybody" song title in the songs table and received the output "Everybody". *


-Left Join: returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.

SELECT title FROM songs LEFT JOIN albums ON songs.title = albums.name

-Right Join: returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1). The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.

(Currently not supported)


-Full Outer Join: returns ALL records when there is a match in either left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
**can potentially return very large result-sets!**
