# Pseudocode the following method:

# An encrypt method that advances every letter of a string one letter forward. So "abc" would become "bcd". For now, you can assume lowercase input and output. Any space character should remain a space character -- no change made.

#Actual coded method:


# Pseudocode the following method:

# A decrypt method that reverses the process above. Note that Ruby doesn't have a built-in method for going backward one letter. How can you find out where a letter is in the alphabet, then access the letter right before it? Hint: In the IRB session above, you learned how to ask a string for the index of a letter. "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" counts as a string.
