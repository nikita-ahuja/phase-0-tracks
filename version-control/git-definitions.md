# Git Definitions
## Nikita Ahuja, Red Pandas Cohort 2017

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows a software system to consist of many versions. This makes it useful because it helps code be more traceable and helps keeps things organized. Because of version control, a developer can understand every bit of modification made to code.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is exactly what is sounds like. A developer will have one main branch - the master branch. This is the foundation of the code, and any changes to this code should not be made directly to it, because if one did so, a developer would not be able to see what changes were made, or, if he/she did not like the changes, he/she would not be able to remove or modify it easily. This is why we work off of branches. We use them anytime we want to add a new feature or modify a foundational piece of code. To work off of a branch, we will bring all the foundational code from the master branch to a newly created branch, modify the code in the new branch, and then, if the final developer likes what he/she sees, the code will then be merged into the master branch!


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is what you do when you record your changes to a repository. A good commit message clearly and succinctly describes the changes made.


* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when merging new code or pulling from a branch into the master branch. It may occur because the codes may not align or are incompatible with each other.
