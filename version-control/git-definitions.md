# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows a software system to consist of many versions. This makes it useful because it helps code be more traceable and helps keeps things organized. Because of version control, a developer can understand every bit of modification made to code.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?



* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?



* What is a merge conflict?
