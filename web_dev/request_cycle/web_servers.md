What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

-Linux is a highly modular operation system.
-"On a linux system, everything is a file. If it is not a file, it's a process."
-free implementation of UNIX
-Linux is a complete multitasking, multiuser operating system (This means that many users can log into and run programs on the same machine simultaneously)
-designed using an open-ended, feature-minded approach

The Linux Way can be summarized as:

-Use programs that do only one task, but do it well.
-To accomplish complex tasks, use several programs linked together.
-Store information in human-readable plain text files whenever it is possible.
-There is no "one true way" to do anything.
-Prefer commandline tools over graphical tools.


In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

As explained in the video , a virtual private server or a virtual machins is "basically a chunk of memory that acts like a computer." The VPS will run its own personal, private copy of a software, and all of its "doors" or ports are closed to the world.
In my head, a VPS is like running a whole new computer on your computer.

Advantages of running a VPS is that one, it is cheaper than a Dedicated Server but almost completely as functional. Also, upgrading is a much easier process. In a VPS, the user has total root control over the server.

Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

You have the ability ot harm the core of your Operating System by mofiying things and running programs on root. Furthermore, there is a large security issue associated with running programs on the root system. It makes your system very vulnerable.
